%% Add PatchWarp directory to MATLAB path
patchwarp_path = pwd;
addpath(genpath(patchwarp_path))

%% Specifiy source directory and saving directory
% Image data needs to be tiff stack files.
ops.source_path = [pwd,filesep,'RH825'];%Z:\People\Ryoma\MC_data\171008\RH825';    % Directory that contains original tiff stack files
ops.save_path = [pwd,filesep,'RH825\corrected'];    % Directory where motion corrected images will be saved

%% Set general parameters
% n_ch:                     Number of saved PMT channels. Set this to 2 for if the session was 2-color imaging.
% align_ch:                 Imaging channel to be aligned
% save_ch:                  Imaging channel to be saved
% run_rigid_mc:             Skip rigid motion correction (0), or do rigid motion correction (1). Skip only if rigid correction was done previously.
% run_affine_wc:            Skip warp correction (0), or do warp correction(1). Note that rigid correction needs to be done to run this warp correction.
ops.n_ch = 1;
ops.align_ch = 1;
ops.save_ch = 1;
ops.run_rigid_mc = 1;
ops.run_affine_wc = 1;

%% Set parameter for downsampled motion corrected tiff stacks
% Downsampled movie will be created after rigid motion correction and affine correction.
% These tiff stack files can be used for visual inspection of the motion correction quality.
% downsample_frame_num:     Window size for non-overlapping moving averaging.
ops.downsample_frame_num = 50; 

%% Specify the number of workers for parallel processing
% worker_num:   Specify the number of workers that processing registrations in parallel. Assign all available CPU cores for the maximum processing
%               speed (e.g. parcluster('local').NumWorkers). If you get 'Out of Memory' error due to limited RAM, assign smaller number of workers.
cluster_properties = parcluster('local');
ops.worker_num = cluster_properties.NumWorkers;
ops.worker_num = 4;

%% Set parameter for rigid motion correction
% rigid_norm_method:            'rank' or 'local'. Default is 'rank'. Try 'local' when 'rank' does not work well. The normalization is always 'local' 
%                               when rigid_template_fftdenoise = true.
% rigid_norm_radius:            Radius of a circular filter for 'local' normalization method. This is used for local intensity normalization before 
%                               hill climbing algorithm. This parameter will be ignored when the method is 'rank'.
% rigid_template_tiffstack_num: Number of tif stack files used for estimating template images. For example, if each tif stack file has 500
%                               frames, each template image will be created using 500*[rigid_template_tiffstack_num] frames.
% rigid_template_block_num:     Number of blocks for an imaging session to be split for rigid motion correction. 
%                               Template image for rigid motion correction is re-estimated for each block.
% rigid_template_threshold:     Quantile threshold for selecting the frames that are used for template images. Pearson correlation coefficient is
%                               calculated between the mean of all frames within a window (specified by rigid_template_tiffstack_num) and each 
%                               frame within the window. Frames with the correlation coefficient lower than the specified quantile threshold will
%                               be ignored when obtaining the final template image.
% rigid_template_center_frac:   Central fraction of a template image used for registration. For example, 10% of pixels are ignored from each edge
%                               when rigid_template_center_frac = 0.8.
% rigid_template_fftdenoise:    If true, strong periodic patterns (e.g. ripple patterns of PMT noise) will be removed from the template images by Fourier transform. 
%                               This function improves the registration accuracy when PMT noise is obvious on the images due to dim calcium signals (e.g. GRIN lens imaging).
ops.rigid_norm_method = 'rank';
ops.rigid_norm_radius = 32;
ops.rigid_template_tiffstack_num = 7;   % Note that this number needs to be smaller than the total number of tif stack files in the directory. Increase this number if the signals are dim.
ops.rigid_template_block_num = 3;   % This must be an odd number (1, 3, 5,...). This parameter will be ignored if [number of tif stack files] < 3.
ops.rigid_template_threshold = 0.2;
ops.rigid_template_center_frac = 0.8;                               
ops.rigid_template_fftdenoise = false;

%% Set parameter for warp correction
% Same transformation will be applied to all frames in each tiff stack by default because of the slow nature of distortion.
% However, if there is only 1 tiff stack in the source directory, the # of frames set by 'downsample_frame_num' will be treated as a single stack (block).

% transform:                            Type of the image transformation. 'affine' works best. ('translation', 'euclidean', 'affine', 'homography')
% affine_norm_radius:                   Radius of a circular filter, which is used for local intensity normalization before gradient-based algorithm.
% warp_pyramid_levels:                  The number of levels in pyramid scheme (1 for a non pyramid implementation).
% warp_pyramid_iterations:              The number of iterations per level.
% warp_template_tiffstack_num:          Number of tif stack files that are used for making the template image.
% warp_movave_tiffstack_num:            Window size for temporally smoothing downsampled images before estimation of affine transformation matrices. 
%                                       Use 1 if the session shows good signals. Increase this number if the S/N of the images are low. Although a 
%                                       large number can improve the accuracy, users should note that distortion needs to be negligible within
%                                       the frames specifed by this parameter.
% warp_blocksize:                       Row and column numbers for splitting FOV. Each image is split into [warp_blocksize]*[warp_blocksize] subfields 
%                                       for estimating and applying affine transformation matrices.
% warp_overlap_pix_frac:                Fraction of edge pixels that overlaps with the adjacent patches. [warp_overlap_pix_frac]*[length of a patch] pixels 
%                                       at the edge of each patch will be shared with the adjacent patch.
%                                       with its adjacent subfields.
% edge_remove_pix:                      Number of pixels that you want to ignore from the lateral edges of a FOV. This may be useful when your FOV contains
%                                       edges that were not scanned by a microscope. 
% n_split4warpinit:                     Sessions are split to this number, and initial affine transformation matrices are re-estimated for each block.
%                                       Gradient descent algorithm find the best matrices from the initial guess.
% affinematrix_rho_threshold:           If the enhanced correlation coefficient between the template and transformed subfield is less than or equal to
%                                       this threshold, the matrix will be ignored before median temporal filtering.
% affinematrix_medfilt_tiffstack_num:   Window size (number of tif stack files) that are used for median temporal filtering of affine transformation matrices.
%                                       1 (no median filtering) should work in most cases. Increase this number if warp corrections fail in some blocks.   
% affinematrix_abssum_threshold:        If the sum of absolute values of all elements in an estimated affine transformation matrix exceeds 
%                                       affinematrix_abssum_threshold, the matrix will be ignored before median temporal filtering.
% affinematrix_abssum_jump_threshold:   Ignore estimated affine matrices when the estimated matrix is very different from the matrix from the adjacent frame. 
%                                       If the sum(abs(matrix1 - matrix2)) > affinematrix_abssum_jump_threshold, the matrix will be ignored.

%% Option to disable making local copies
% On Linux or Mac OS, tiff files will be temporarily copied in a temporary folder by default if they are 
% in a network drive because the pipeline is faster this way in many cases. This behavior can be disabled 
% by this setting network_temp_copy = 0. More efficient tiff reader (ScanImageTiffreader) will be used on Windows, and 
% it directly reads tiff in a network drive without making local copies ('network_temp_copy' parameter will be ignored on Windows).

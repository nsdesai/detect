When the local normalization method is selected, images are normalized by dividing each pixel value by the mean of pixel values in the local neighborhood. The parameter normalization radius determines the size of the neighborhood. (When the rank normalization method is chosen, this parameter does nothing.) The radius should be expressed in pixels and correspond to the approximate size of expected non-uniformity.

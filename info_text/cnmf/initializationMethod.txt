A greedy algorithm is an approach to optimization that selects the most appropriate choice at any moment based on the current situation without regard to past performance. Even if the initial decision was incorrect or led it farther away from a cost minimum, it never reverses itself or backtracks. It just picks the best choice given immediate conditions. CNMF attempts to find the best factorization of image data into spatial and temporal matrices, which is a kind of optimization problem. Its default is to use greedy optimization. A second choice, "sparse NMF," is also offered, which in principle may be better for detecting non-somatic structures, such as axons and dendrites. In practice, greedy optimization is the best choice for nearly all preparations.
